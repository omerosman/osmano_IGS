My project focuses more on sound and sound related visuals. When the program starts
it plays So What by Miles Davis, if click any button it pauses and an image of Miles Davis
appears until you release the button which resumes playback. Anytime the music plays the 
frequency graph appears.

Code for frequency graph came from OF soundPlayerFFTExample:
